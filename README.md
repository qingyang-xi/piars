Polyphonic Instrumental Analysis and ReSynthesis

TODO:
1) Get Chord recognition from Audio file working
2) Get spectral templates from SoundFont
3) Use Tempaltes to do NMF




* When featuers are generated, save them in a temp folder. Temp featuers can be discarded when the whole Analysis/Resynthesis is completed.
